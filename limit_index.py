'''
Given a package with a weight limit limit and an array arr of item weights,
implement a function getIndicesOfItemWeights that finds two items whose sum
of weights equals the weight limit limit. Your function should return a pair
[i, j] of the indices of the item weights, ordered such that i > j. If such
a pair doesnâ€™t exist, return an empty array.

input:  arr = [4, 6, 10, 15, 16],  lim = 21

output: [3, 1] # since these are the indices of the
               # weights 6 and 15 whose sum equals to 21
